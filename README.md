# K-Means Clustering and KNN Prediction in Python
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm built from scratch in Python, alongside an example utilizing the scikit-learn library. The project showcases key concepts in unsupervised learning by clustering a dataset and predicting the cluster membership of a new data point using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

1. Implement a K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, demonstrating core concepts such as centroids, cluster assignments, and updates.
2. Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to facilitate visualization.
3. Predict the cluster membership of a new data point using KNN.
4. Evaluate the clustering performance using the Silhouette Score, a measure of how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

## Key Components
1. Data Preprocessing using PCA
2. K-Means Clustering
3. Evaluation with Silhouette Score
4. KNN Prediction
